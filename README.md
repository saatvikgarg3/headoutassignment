To Create Test Files i have console logged the path where you can create files and run it on your localhost.       

Server.js is the starting point for the file. 
i have commented all the necessary deatils in there, you can checkout while analyzing the code


I am currently unaware of Docker so wont be able to do that part as the deadline was short and i wont be able to learn in one day but i am sure my problem solving skills are best for the role,and the Docker can be easily learned in a week.
